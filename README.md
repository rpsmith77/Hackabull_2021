# Color-Blind-Friendly Generative Art<br>Hackabull 2021 - **Most Impactful Hack Winner**
Art should be accessible. [Approximetly 5%](https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/) of the world has some form of color blindness. Often times, when something is being designed, color blindness is not something taken into consideration. The designers aren't being malicious, people are just inherently biased. My program makes a conscious effort to be inclusive to people with color blindness by using a [color-blind-friendly color palette](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind). The program randomly generates art and saves it in a .svg file. The background color, number of shapes, and types of shapes are all randomized. By using .svg files, the art has the ability to be losslessly scaled.
## Inspiration
I was inspired by 90's geometric art. The images created feel adjacent to [Memphis Group patterns.](https://www.creativebloq.com/inspiration/10-iconic-examples-of-memphis-design) I was also inspired when I read [this medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/is-generative-art-for-you-b1e1499945e6) about generative art, earlier this month.
